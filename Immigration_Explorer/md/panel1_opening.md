# About this Project: US Immigration Explorer

<br></br>

Every single year, there are roughly 1,000,000 immigrants coming into the US from various origins and through different admission channels. Where are the immigrants coming from? How are the immigrants fitting in once they are in the US? 

This project hopes to help answer such questions by visualizing and analyzing immigration related datasets from Homeland Security and US Census Bureau. <br></br>

On the **Overview** tab, you will see the overall immigration status across time and geography into US. <br></br>
On the **A Closer Look** tab, you can dive into one of the top 10 immigration source countries, and examine the specific immigration, social and economic status for a particular group. <br></br>
On the **Story** tab, you will see some regression analysis attempting to answer the relationship between certain metrics, together with a video as a highlight walk-through journey. <br></br>
Last but not least, on the **About** tab, you will see details about this open-source project. <br></br>
