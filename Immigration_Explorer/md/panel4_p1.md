**#Raw Data Source**

My raw data comes from two sources: 

1. Homeland Security: 
https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics/yearbook

    covering annual immigration count by different characteristics (visa type, country of origin etc.)

2. American Fact Finder(US Census Bureau): https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml?refresh=t#none

    covering US resident census data(immigration status, english speaking capability, in labor force or not, etc.)
    
Both data sets address the issue of immigrants to US, segmented by country and state of origin. Note that the US Census Bureau data covers all immigrants *living* in US in that particular year, while the Homeland Security data covers immigrants *moving* to US in that year. Therefore, there is strong connection between the two datasets, yet the Homeland Security sample population is only part of the US Census Bureau sample population.
